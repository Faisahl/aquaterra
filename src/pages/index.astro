    <h2>Why <span class="underline-aq">Biofloc</span></h2>
    <p>
      Our biofloc-based aquaculture systems are engineered to deliver consistent, commercial-scale production while maintaining strict control over water quality and animal health. By operating in a closed, monitored environment, we significantly reduce exposure to external contamination, seasonal variability, and disease outbreaks common in traditional pond-based systems.
    </p>
		<p>
			Biofloc technology enables minimal water exchange, allowing beneficial microbial communities to recycle waste nutrients directly within the system. This results in improved feed conversion ratios, more stable growth rates, and reduced dependency on external water sources — a key advantage in regions where water efficiency and biosecurity are critical.
		</p>
		<!-- <p>
			Our production cycles are planned, repeatable, and measurable, supporting predictable harvest volumes and scheduling. This level of control allows us to align output with domestic distribution requirements and export timelines, providing buyers with reliable supply, traceability, and consistent quality across batches.

    <h2>About Our Operation</h2>
    <p>
      Our team brings international training and professional experience to the region, applying structured operational practices, detailed record-keeping, and data-driven decision-making throughout the production process. These standards inform how our systems are designed, monitored, and documented — from stocking and feed management to water quality control and harvest planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      We operate modern biofloc-based aquaculture systems designed to meet commercial and export-oriented supply requirements. Our approach emphasizes operational efficiency, water conservation, biosecurity, and consistent harvest quality across production cycles.
    </p>

    <p>
      By combining globally recognized production methodologies with local operational expertise, we support wholesalers, processors, and exporters seeking reliable supply, traceability, and predictable output. Our production model is built to align with the expectations of international buyers while remaining well-adapted to regional conditions.
